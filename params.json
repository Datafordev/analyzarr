Clone the git repository - https://github.com/msarahan/analyzarr\r\n2. Run setup.py - preferably with pip:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip setup.py install\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Windows x64 shortcut\r\nA customized installation of WinPython () has been created that has all of Analyzarr's prerequisites installed.  You can download it from here:\r\n\r\nhttp://t3hmikez0r.com/static/analyzarr/WinPython-64bit-2.7.3.3.7z\r\n\r\nThe Analyzarr installation in that folder is not kept up to date.  To get a more up-to-date version, you have two options:\r\n\r\n1. Download a binary installer for Analyzarr.  These are built infrequently.  They are here:\r\nhttp://t3hmikez0r.com/static/analyzarr/\r\n\r\n2. Build a new binary installer.  Clone the source code from github, then go to that folder and run this command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py bdist_wininst\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither way, install the binary installer like so:\r\n  1. Install this by opening the WinPython control panel.\r\n  2. Uninstall the previously installed version of analyzarr\r\n  3. Drag and drop the binary installer into the WinPython control panel's install tab.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nEmail the Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/analyzarr-dev","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
