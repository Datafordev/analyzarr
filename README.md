analyzarr
=========

Analyzarr is high-resolution image analysis by pirates, for pirates.

The primary purpose of this software is the study of relationships among peaks in crystalline structures. It was developed originally for transmission electron microscope data, specifically high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM images. Hopefully, it might be useful for other data where small patterns in spatially repetitive data need to be identified.

Analyzarr has been developed using a kindly donated license for the Wing Pro IDE.  Its debugging capabilities have been instrumental.

Analyzarr is open source (released under the BSD license.)  Note that one file falls under the GPL - HyperSpy's DM3 reader, under io_plugins/digital_micrograph.py.  If you intend to distribute Analyzarr, you must either release your distribution under the GPL, or remove/replace the DM3 reader with BSD-compatible or proprietary code.
