analyzarr
=========

Analyzarr is hyperdimensional data analysis by pirates, for pirates.

The primary purpose of this software is exploratory multivariate data analysis.  It was developed
originally for transmission electron microscope data, specifically electron energy loss spectra
and high-resolution high-angle annular dark-field STEM images.  Hopefully, it might be useful for
other data where small patterns in spectrally or spatially repetitive data need to be identified.

Analyzarr has been developed using a kindly donated license for the Wing Pro IDE.  Its debugging capabilities have been instrumental.

Analyzarr is open source (released under the BSD license.)  Note that one file falls under the GPL - HyperSpy's DM3 reader, under io_plugins/digital_micrograph.py.  If you intend to distribute Analyzarr, you must either release your distribution under the GPL, or remove/replace the DM3 reader with BSD-compatible or proprietary code.
