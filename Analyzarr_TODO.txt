GOALS:
Start to finish:
- Load image data (done)
- crop cells (done)
- locate and characterize peaks on cells
- present several analysis methods
  - MDA
  - peak char ratios
- plot results
  - overlay of factors (peak heights, shifts, etc.) on cells
  - overlay of scores on original images
  - overlay of peak ID #'s for identifying peaks to select peak chars from

BONUS:
- spectral MDA - provide base functionality, but defer to hyperspy
- other machine learning methods - neural nets?

STEPS TO ACHIEVE:
- restore plotting of results from Hyperspy

File structure:
- group per experiment:
   - group for each cropping experiment
     - subgroup for analyses

2013/01/12:
define "experiment" structure for mda:
- date
- type
- results

UI:
provide menu to choose from available mda runs
